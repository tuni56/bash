# awk & sed
AWK shows information by columns, for example:
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F ":" '{print $1}'     : is the pattern that awk will look for and will show the fisrt column
ps | awk '{print $4}'

GREP is useful for search

SED is useful for search and replace
i.e.  touch topping.txt
      nano topping.txt (You can find the file in this repo if you like, if not the case, type some pizza's topping such as pepperoni)
      cat topping.txt
      sed 's /Pineapple/Cheddar/' topping.txt  (it will replace Pineapple for Cheddar only in the screen. If yopu checked the file content you woudn't find any changes)
      sed -i 's /Pineapple/Cheddar/' topping.txt (the replace will occur in the file)
