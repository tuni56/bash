How It Works
Argument Validation: The script expects one argument, the path to the accounts.csv file. If the argument is missing or the file doesn't exist, it exits with an error message.

Name Formatting: The format_name function takes the name and surname, converts them to lowercase, and then capitalizes the first letter of each.

Email Formatting: The format_email function constructs the email based on the first letter of the name and the full surname. It checks if the email already exists in the output file. If it does, it appends the location_id to ensure uniqueness.

File Processing: The script reads the input file line by line, skipping the header. It applies the name and email formatting and writes the updated data to accounts_new.csv.
