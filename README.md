# Automating sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade with Bash

## Introduction
Tired of manually typing sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade every time you want to update your system? Let's automate this tedious task with a simple Bash script! This script will automatically execute the commands, saving you time and effort.

## Getting Started
Clone the Repository using the git clone instruction
Make the Script Executable: chmod +x script.sh
Simply run the script from your terminal: ./script.sh
The script will handle the rest, updating your system's package list and upgrading packages.

## Customization
While the script is designed to work out of the box, you can customize it to your needs:

Additional Commands: If you want to add more commands to the script, simply append them to the existing ones within the script file.
Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
Scheduling: Consider using a task scheduler like cron to automate the script execution on a regular basis.
